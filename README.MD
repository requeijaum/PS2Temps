As seen on [PS2-Home.com](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=8750&sid=36ac48c6ca316dc684ae5871ae612afc).

Here is a quick and ugly ELF (app) for showing your PS2 Temperatures. Works for PS2 models 50004 and later. 

NOTE: Temperatures for PHAT models are way higher than SLIMS, over 50C/122F. On all SLIMS models 90004 is a bit higher which makes sense due to integration power supply, around 33C/91.4F while other slims 26C/78.8F.
